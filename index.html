        <b>WHY I GOT INTO CODING?</b>
        <br>The many reson i wanted to code was because i was watching youtube video and saw how much knowing just a little bit of code could change someone life.
        <br>And a lot of video would say like oh coding is not so hard to learn everyone makes you think that but if you take the time and really want to learn it you could know a lot in just a month so i gave
        <b>
            <a href="https://www.sololearn.com">SoloLearn</a>
        </b> a try and it took me far too the point im at now.
        <br>The only reason i say give it a try is because it not just like you have to be on a computer to learn code they have a app for on the go so you can do it on the phone or at home on your computer or ipad or anything really and it is free so i say do it now before everyone try to be a coder.
